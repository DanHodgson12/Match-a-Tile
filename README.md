# Match-a-Tile

![Match-a-Tile Final Design](readme-files/mat-mockup-final.png)

The 'Match-a-Tile' game is a memory challenge based on 'Kim's Game' , whereby the player is shown a number of items, which are then covered after a period of time. The player then has to remember the items they were shown and guess what was there. In this version of the game, players must match the tiles at the bottom of the screen with the computer's tiles.

The primary goal of this project is to offer the user a fun and interactive game to play while, at the same time, provide a challenge to test the user's memory.

## Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](readme-files/mat-colour-scheme.png)

The colours used for this website are:

- Sunset (#EAC086) - for the computer & player tiles and the navbar logo. This colour is loosely based on the color for the [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) tile.
- Papaya Whip (#FFEFD5) - for the side bar.
- Silver (#A9A9A9) - for the computer-tiles background
- Onyx (#3D3D3D) - for the player-tiles background.
- Eerie Black (#212529) - for the Mode-selection, About and Instructions buttons.

## Typography

The font used throughout this project is the sans-serif font that loads as standard depending on browser choice. The reason for this is that I wanted to keep the styling basic and focus more on the functionality of the game. Also, I like how the standard font looks and feel it goes well with the styling of the images for the tiles.

## Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used to showcase the visuals of the game across the three main screen sizes.
