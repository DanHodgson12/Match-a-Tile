# Match-a-Tile

![Match-a-Tile Final Design](readme-files/mat-mockup-final.png)

The 'Match-a-Tile' game is a memory challenge based on 'Kim's Game' , whereby the player is shown a number of items, which are then covered after a period of time. The player then has to remember the items they were shown and guess what was there. In this version of the game, players must match the tiles at the bottom of the screen with the computer's tiles.

The primary goal of this project is to offer the user a fun and interactive game to play while, at the same time, provide a challenge to test the user's memory.

## Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](readme-files/mat-colour-scheme.png)

The colours used for this website are:

- Sunset (#EAC086) - for the computer & player tiles and the navbar logo. This colour is loosely based on the color for the [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) tile.
- Papaya Whip (#FFEFD5) - for the side bar.
- Silver (#A9A9A9) - for the computer-tiles background
- Onyx (#3D3D3D) - for the player-tiles background.
- Eerie Black (#212529) - for the Mode-selection, About and Instructions buttons.

## Typography

The font used throughout this project is the sans-serif font that loads as standard depending on browser choice. The reason for this is that I wanted to keep the styling basic and focus more on the functionality of the game. Also, I like how the standard font looks and feel it goes well with the styling of the images for the tiles.

## Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used to showcase the visuals of the game across the three main screen sizes.

The full version of wireframes can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FKLPRejh6ElgwCStCXU0IF/Match-a-Tile-WireFrames?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=1RPCNTWt2wE6rDEL-0).

# Features

- The website was designed from a mobile-first perspective.
- The website is responsive on all screen sizes, including very small screens such as the Galaxy Fold.
  - This allows the user to [view the website on a variety of screen sizes](#user-stories).

## Navbar

![Navbar on medium & small screen sizes](readme-files/features-navbar-tablet-phone.png)

The Navbar consists of:

- The game logo (styled from the tiles used in the game).
  - This is a clickable button that refreshes the page and resets the game.
- The game heading.
- The About button.
  - This opens a modal with information about the game.

![About Modal Image](readme-files/features-about-modal.png)

- The Instructions button.
  - This opens a modal with the instructions for the game.

![Instructions Modal Image](readme-files/features-instructions-modal.png)

On larger screen sizes, the About and Instructions buttons disappear and this information is displayed in the [Side Bar](#side-bar).

## Side Bar

The Side Bar consists of:

- The About button.
  - This slide-toggles a drop-down box showing information about the game.
- The Information button.
  - This slide-toggles a drop-down box showing the instructions for the game.

![Side Bar Image](readme-files/features-sidebar.png)

On screen sizes below large, the Side Bar disappears and the About and Information buttons move to the [Navbar](#navbar).

## Controls

![Controls Area Image](readme-files/features-controls.png)

The Controls area consists of:

### Mode Selection

![Mode Selection Image](readme-files/features-mode-selector.png)

- This toggles a drop-down menu where the user can select a mode (Easy, Normal or Hard).

### Mode Display

![Mode Display Image](readme-files/features-mode-display.png)

- This displays the mode the user has selected from the Mode selection drop-down menu.
- The mode displayed changes depending on the user's selection.

### Start Button

![Start Button Image](readme-files/features-start-button.png)

- This starts the game, which causes several things to happen:
  - Disables the Start button.
  - Disables the Mode selection button.
  - Assigns random images to the Computer Tiles.
  - Shuffles those same images and assigns them to the Player Tiles.
  - Starts the Countdown Timer.
  - Shows the Computer Tiles.
  - Hides the Computer Tiles once the Countdown Timer ends.
  - Shows the Player Tiles once the Countdown Timer ends.

### Reset Button

![Reset Button Image](readme-files/features-reset-button.png)

- This resets the game, which causes several things to happen:
  - Hides both the Computer and Player Tiles.
  - Removes all images from all Tiles.
  - Resets the 'Score' and 'Turns Left' displays.
  - Enables the Start button.
  - Enables the Mode selection button.

## Computer Area

![Computer Area Image](readme-files/features-computer-area.png)

The Computer Area consists of:

### Turns Left

![Turns Left Image](readme-files/features-turns.png)

- This displays the number of the turns the user has left to match the tiles before the game is over.
- The number of turns left at the start of the game is determined by the Mode selected:
  - Easy - 18 turns
  - Normal - 14 turns
  - Hard - 9 turns
- When the Turns Left reaches 0, the game ends.

### Countdown Timer

![Countdown Timer Gif](readme-files/features-countdown-timer.gif)

- The Countdown Timer starts after the user has clicked the Start button.
- It counts down from 5 to the word 'GO'.
- It displays how long the user has to memorise the Computer Tiles before they are flipped over/hidden.
- Once it reaches the word 'GO', the Computer Tiles are hidden and the Player Tiles are shown.
- The game then begins and the user is able to click on the Player Tiles to match them with the Computer Tiles.

### Score

![Score Image](readme-files/features-score.png)

- The Score area displays the amount of correct matches the user has made.
- Once the Score reaches 9/9, the game ends.
  - However, the game can end prematurely if the Turns Left reaches 0 before the Score reaches 9/9.
  - For example, the user could use all of their turns and only score 4/9 and the game will end.
- The Score is reset at the start of the game or when the game is reset.
- The Score cannot exceed 9/9.

### Computer Tiles

![Computer Tiles Image](readme-files/features-computer-tiles.png)

- The Computer Tiles consist of 9 buttons that the user can click.
  - The buttons are disabled at the start of the game.
  - The buttons are enabled after the user has clicked on a Player Tile so that it can be matched with a Computer Tile.
  - Once the user has successfully matched two Tiles, that particular Computer Tile will have a green inner-border and will be disabled.
  - If the user unsuccessfully matches two Tiles, that particular Computer Tile will momentarily have a red inner-border, but can be selected in the user's next turn. That Computer Tile will remain disabled until the user has clicked on a Player Tile to match it with a Computer Tile.
- These tiles flip over (so they are shown) when the user clicks the Start button and the Countdown Timer has begun.
- The tiles then flip over again (so they are hidden) once the Countdown Timer has ended.
- If the user successfully matches a Player Tile with a Computer Tile, that particular Computer Tile will flip over (be shown).
- If the user unsuccessfully matches the two tiles, that particular Computer Tile will remain hidden.
- A random selection of 9 images are assigned to the Computer Tiles after the user clicks the Start button.

## Player Tiles

![Player Tiles Image](readme-files/features-player-tiles.png)

- The Player Tiles consist of 9 buttons that the user can click.
  - The buttons are disabled at the start of the game.
  - The buttons are enabled after the Countdown Timer has ended and the Computer Tiles have been flipped (hidden).
  - When the user has clicked on a Player Tile, all other Player Tiles are disabled and the Computer Tiles are enabled.
  - Once the user has successfully matched a Player Tile with a Computer Tile, that particular Player Tile will have a green inner-border and will be disabled.
  - If the user unsuccessfully matches two Tiles, that particular Player Tile will momentarily have a red inner-border, but can be selected in the user's next turn.
- These tiles flip over (so they are shown) after the Countdown Timer has ended and the Computer Tiles have been flipped (hidden).
- The tiles remain visible throughout the game.
- The same 9 images assigned to the Computer Tiles are shuffled and assigned to the Player Tiles at the start of the game.

## Flip Functionality

![Flip Functionality Gif](readme-files/features-countdown-flip.gif)

- The Computer Tiles and Player Tiles are flipped depending on the state of the game, or whether a successful match has been made.
- They flip on the Y-axis at a rate of 0.6 seconds.
- The images are assigned to the tiles before any of the tiles are flipped.
  - This ensures that the user has enough time to register the image.
  - It also adds to the visual representation of the game.

## Tile Matching

![Tile Matching Gif](readme-files/features-tile-matching.gif)

- When the user clicks on a Player Tile, a blue inner-border is added to indicate it has been clicked.
  - If the user then clicks on a Computer Tile and it's a successful match:
    - The Computer Tile flips over (is shown) and a green inner-border is added.
    - A green inner-border is also added to the Player Tile.
    - Both tiles are disabled for the remainder of the game.
  - If the user then clicks on a Computer Tile and it's not a match:
    - The Computer Tile momentarily gains a red inner-border but does not flip over (remains hidden).
    - The Player Tile momentarily gains a red inner-border but can be selected in the user's next turn.

## Game Over

![Game Over Gif](readme-files/features-game-over.gif)

- When the user has scored 9 out of 9 and/or has run out of turns, the Game Over function is executed.
  - The phrase GAME OVER appears above the Computer Tiles.
  - An 'Alert' is displayed at the top of the screen.
    - The 'Alert' displays the user's Score.
- The user then has to click the 'Alert' and click the Reset button to reset the game.

## Footer

## Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services were used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax/elements in the HTML & CSS.

The W3C Markup Validator returned a one error:

- The use of `div` elements inside `button` elements.
  - This was overcome by changing the `div` elements to `span` elements.

![Markup Validation Image 1](readme-files/html-validation-error.png)
![Markup Validation Image 2](readme-files/html-validation.png)

The W3C CSS Validator returned no errors in the code.
![CSS Validation Image](readme-files/css-validation.png)

The [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) service was used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax in the JavaScript.

JS Hint returned no errors or warnings. However, it did report several instances of undefined variables.

![JS Hint Report Image](readme-files/jshint-validation.png)

This was due to the use of jQuery throughout the project and didn't require adjustments to the code.

## Lighthouse Report

Lighthouse in Google Chrome Dev Tools was used to test performance, accessibility, best practices and search engine optimisation of the webpage.

![Lighthouse Report](readme-files/lh-report.png)

One of the suggestions made for increasing Performance was to remove element IDs that weren't defined in CSS. However, elements that fell into this category had IDs for manipulation via JavaScript.

## Tools Testing

- [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  - Google Chrome DevTools was used throughout the development process to test, explore and make changes to the HTML and CSS of the webpage.
  - Google Chrome DevTools was used throughout the development process to test, explore and make changes to the JavaScript controlling the game's functionality, including the use of 'console.log'.

- Responsiveness
  - [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) was used to check responsiveness across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
  - [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to check responsiveness across different screen sizes and generate the mockup final image.
  - [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used to check responsiveness across different screen sizes during the development and testing phases.
